                        <h2>Alfie</h2>
                        <p>Meet Alfie, the teeny guinea baby who had it kind of tough since the start of her life. Bright lights, yet nobody was home. She was a tiny little thing, always making noise when she moved around. She passed away in June, 2018.</p>

                        <h2>Pip</h2>
                        <p>Say hi to Pip! With her 4,5 years, the eldest of the tribe. She came to live with us together with Alfie and is still going strong. She is a unit of absolute love and loves eating more than anything in the world. </p>

                        <h2>Ms Universe</h2>
                        <p>Ms Universe is the latest addition and comes from a piggy sanctuary. She has been rescued with 30 other piggies from an awful home and we don't know how old she is. She is tiny, quiet, but very lovable and sweet.</p>
